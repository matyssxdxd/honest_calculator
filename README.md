# Honest Calculator
A simple project createt during JetBrains Python for Beginners course.
The calculator asks user for equation that it solves, but during solving it prints different type of "honest text" if the given equation is really easy to do.
It also offers the user to save the result that you can use in your next equation, if the result is really simple then the calculator asks user if it really wants to save it.
